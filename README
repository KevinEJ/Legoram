You have to write a program in order to defend your village.

There are three kinds of buildings, houses, walls, and cannons, and four actions, "build house", "upgrade wall", "upgrade cannon",and "fire", in this game.

# in this version, "upgrade wall" and "upgrade cannon" are "build wall" and "build cannon"

At each step, you can choose an action.
"build house" may increase the number of the villages by one.
"upgrade cannon" may increase your attack points by the number of your villages.
"upgrade wall" may increase your health points by the number of your illages, too.
"fire" means to attack your opponent, making the HP of your opponent decrease by your attack points.

Besides, you can use "if/else" with ">" or "=" to make different decisions.

"m_house"  means the number of your villagers.
"m_wall"   means your HP.
"m_cannon" means your attack point.
"e_house"  means the number of your opponent's villagers.
"e_wall"   means your opponent's HP.
"e_cannon" means your opponent's attack point.

Noting that "e_if" and "e_else" cost a step for detecting the values of your opponent, and "m_if" and "m_else" cost nothing but you can use any parameter about your opponent in it.

Whenever your HP decreases to zero, you lose the game.

Some exemples are in the file "mine" and "enemy".
